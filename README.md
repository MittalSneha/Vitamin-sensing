# Vitamin-sensing
In this project work we propose a machine learning aided solid-state nanopore for detection of vitamin B1 molecules at the single-molecule level. Using the signature nanopore transmission readouts, we try to identify vitamin B1 from its two phosphorylated derivatives with good sensitivity and selectivity. To significantly reduce the time of vitamin B1 identification, we coupled the approach with explainable ML tools, which enabled the identification of vitamin B1 molecules in different translation dynamics with a good accuracy score. Apart from identification, the approach can also distinguish each ternary and binary vitamin B1 molecule simultaneously with an accuracy score > 99.5 %.
